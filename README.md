AdventOfCode
---
This repository contains solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles.
You may find note two folder:
 - Bedo: [Alle Bedo](https://github.com/AlleBedo) solutions
 - Palma: [Alle Palma](https://github.com/justpalma) solutions

Why didn't [Alle Bedo](https://github.com/AlleBedo) use his own repository?
1. **He is VERY lazy**
2. We are competing to write the ugliest solution and keeping everything in a single repository makes it easier
